OBJECTIVE:
-Today we live in the millennium era of dreams where every person is in a rat race to achieve one thing or the other in their life.

The main objective of our idea is to build a feasible and interactive community of alumni and students of every university individually and then have a collective community of all universities throughout the state of Odisha.

IMPLEMENTATION:
--> We are planning to implement the idea of an expansive student-alumni community through our idea of ALMALINK.

--> Here we are planning to make an online expansive community called ALMALINK by making a responsive website and an android application.

APPLICATION:
--> We believe that this effort will collectively provide the necessary exposure as well as the work experience required for the competitive society of today's world.

--> Our idea has a unique combination of freelancing and student-alumni interaction that is never seen before on such social media platforms.

--> We also have a plan to build paid courses by the alumni at a very affordable cost.

-->  Another attraction in our community will be the paid articles where the alumni will share their experiences and guide the students on a daily basis. 

--> The alumni will work closely with students and provide the necessary recommendations and freelancing work to deserving candidates.

--> our website and app will contain the database containing the alumni details of different universities so that students can easily interact with their alumni.

-->We have a unique idea of organizing the biggest tech-fest of Odisha  "ALUMINISTA"  where we are going to conduct different competitive events such as blind coding, speed coding, etc. The scores will earn them extra marks in the interviews with the tie-up companies.

FUTURE-ENDEAVORSWe have a fiery fire in our hearts to make this attempt of building an ever-expanding community of students and alumni a grand success. As of now, we are in the building phase and we are growing exponentially with our vision getting stronger each day. We are planning to build a website and an app to make this community expansive and accessible to every person across Odisha and then we are planning to expand it to other states of our country every college student must have the necessary exposure to succeed in life and we at ALMALINK are trying to build the biggest student-alumni community.
